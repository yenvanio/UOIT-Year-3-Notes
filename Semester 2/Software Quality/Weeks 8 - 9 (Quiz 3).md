## Week 8 -  Trade offs for Software Quality, Principles of Test Planning and Test Execution

### Trade Offs & Their Implications
- **Robustness vs. Size**
  - To be robust need error handling and recovery
  - Means extra code a.k.a extra size

- **Make vs. Buy**
  - Might want to use existing code instead of making from scratch
  - Have to deal with existing bugs in platform

- **Feature Parity vs. Platform Disparity**
  - Software usually implemented for multiple platforms (iOS vs. Android)
  - Different platforms have different capabilities, so sometimes some features can't be on both

- **Security vs. Usability**
  - Don't need super extra security for something that doesn't need it
  - Sacrifice less important security depending on how it's meant to be used

- **Memory vs. Performance**
  - Performance is better with more memory
  - Construct software depending on whether platform can handle resource intensive vs. resource constrained

### Software Test Plan
- The Software Test Plan (STP) is designed to prescribe the scope, approach, resources, and schedule of all testing activities.

#### Structure of Software Test Plan ( STP )
- **1 - Introduction**
  - **1.1** Objectives

    - High Level Test plan for each level of testing
  - **1.3** Scope
    - Plans for producing scheduled and unscheduled updates to the STP
  - **1.4** Reference Manual
  - **1.5** Definitions & Acronyms

- **2 - Test Items**
  - **2.1** Program Modules
  - **2.2** Job Control Procedures
  - **2.3** User Procedures
  - **2.4** Operator Procedures

- **3 - Features to be Tested**

- **4 - Features Not to be Tested**

- **5 - Approach**
  - **5.1** Component Testing
  - **5.2** Integration Testing
  - **5.3** Conversion Testing
  - **5.4** Job Stream Testing
  - **5.5** Interface Testing
  - **5.6** Security Testing
  - **5.7** Recovery Testing
  - **5.8** Performance Testing
  - **5.9** Regression Testing

- **7 - Testing Process**
  - **7.1** Test Deliverables
  - **7.2** Testing Tasks
  - **7.3** Responsibilities
  - **7.4** Resources
  - **7.5** Schedule

- **8 - Environmental Requirements**
  - **8.1** Hardware
  - **8.2** Software
  - **8.3** Security
