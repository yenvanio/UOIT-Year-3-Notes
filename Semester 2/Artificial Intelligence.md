### Artificial Intelligence
- Definitions
  - The synthesis and analysis of computational agents that act intelligently
    - Agent: Something that acts in an environment
  - Characteristics of an Intelligent Agent
    - Actions are appropriate for it's goals and circumstances
    - Flexible to changing environments and goals
    - Learns from experience
    - Makes appropriate choices given perceptual and computational limitations
- Examples
  - Organizations: Microsoft, Al Qaeda, Government, CS Department
  - People: Teacher, Stock Trader, Engineering, Farmer, Waiter
  - Devices: Thermostat, UI, Airplane, Autonomous Car, Game
  - Animals: Dog, Mouse, Bird, Insect
- Goals
  - Scientific Goal: Understand the principles that make intelligent behavior possible in natural or artificial systems
    - Analyze natural and artificial agents
    - Formulate and test hypotheses about what it takes to construct intelligent agents
    - Design, Build, Experiment with computational systems that perform tasks that require intelligence
  - Engineering Goal: Design useful, intelligent artifacts

### Agents
- Agents have
    - Abilities
    - Goals / Preferences
    - Prior Knowledge
- Agent / Environment Interactions
  - Agent performs actions on environment
  - Agent makes observations about the environment
    - Current observations
  - Agent has past experiences with the environment
    - Past observations
- Example
  - Teacher
    - Abilities: Present new concepts, Prepare tests, Explain concepts
    - Goals: Particular knowledge, Skills, Social skills
    - Prior Knowledge: Subject material, Teaching strategies
    - Observations: Test results, Facial expressions
    - Past Experiences: Prior test results, Effects of teaching strategies
