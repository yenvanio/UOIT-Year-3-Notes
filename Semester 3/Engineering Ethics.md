## Midterm 1 Case Studies

### Paperco vs Manuco
- Manuco is building something for Paperco. Paperco would pay monthly installments over the manufacturing period
- Each payment is due at the end of the month, if not paid within 10 days of the due date, Manuco is entitled to terminate the contract.
- Paperco has some financial issues and some payments are delayed by up to 20 days, however Manuco allows it and says it's okay as long as payments are not made later than 30 days from the due date.
- Further down the manufacturing period, Manuco realizes it stands to lose more money by completing the project and when the next payment was 15 days late, Manuco terminated the contract.

#### Was Manuco entitled to terminate the contract?
- Manuco developed a pattern allowing Paperco to `breach the term in the contract` where they were able to delay the payments up to 20 days.
- Manuco representatives made a `verbal agreement` indicating that this was okay.
- Although courts will not look into verbal agreements or actions made before the signing of a contract, they will look into ones made after the signing if there is a `question of equitability` (unfairness).
- Because there is a pattern of Manuco sanctioning the breach of contract, they would be `equitably estopped`.
  - **Equitable Estoppel**: Prevents one party from taking advantage of another when, through false language or conduct, the person to be estopped has induced another person to act in a certain way, which resulted in the other person being injured in some way.


### HESI vs ERRS
- ERRS agreed to build a heat recovery system for HESI costing $600,000. After reviewing HESI's process, they guaranteed the appliance would recover 40% of the heat (written in contract).
- The contract limited ERRS total liability to $600,000 for any loss or damage.
- The appliance could not recover more than 5% of the heat. HESI hired another company for $800,000 replacing ERRS and achieving the performance that was promised by ERRS.
- ERRS received $500,000 under this contract.

#### What contract law claim HESI can make against ERRS?
- ERRS `breached its contract` with HESI, so HESI is allowed to `claim direct damages`.
- HESI can claim up to $600,000. However, must absorb the $100,000 difference between the original contract and the total cost of $700,000, once damages are paid by ERRS.
  - Originally supposed to pay $600,000. Only paid $500,000
  - Cost another $800,000 to replace with new company
  - Total Cost: $700,000 + Damages by ERRS
- ERRS may be able to claim `quantum meruit` for part of the $100,000 difference between money received and what was stated in the contract.
  - **Quantum Meruit**: 'What one has earned' : Reasonable value of services

### Owner v Mammoth
- Mammoth hired an architectural firm to design them a building. Architect agreed they would arrange for inspection services to make sure everything was carried out correctly.
- Architect hired a structural engineering firm to get them a design for the building and Mammoth hired Swift to construct their building.
- Swift told Mammoth they could save money by using a different material for a certain part of the construction.
- Mammoth asked for the architects advice and they asked the engineering firms representative & inspector at the time (Jim).
- The original material had been specified by an ex-engineer and it was based on soil conditions. Under lots of pressure from Mammoth and Swift to approve the new material and not delay the construction process, Jim approved it.
- The new material was no good and cost more money to redo after damages.

#### What are the potential liabilities in tort law arising from this case?
- Jim was expected to `apply reasonable care` and therefore owes a `duty of care` to Swift.
- Jim negligently approved the material; Swift was negligent in proposing the new material on the `basis of availability and not suitability`.
- Engineering firm is responsible for its employees and such is `responsible for injuries sustained by Mammoth.`
