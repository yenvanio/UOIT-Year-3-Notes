- **ITU-T**: The International Telecommunication Union
  - International Organization within the United Nations System
  - Governments and private sector coordinate global telecom networks and services
- **ISO**: The International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
  - Non-Governmental organization that promotes the development of standardization and related activities
  - Facilitating international exchange of goods and services

### Computer Security Concepts
- **Computer Security**: Measures and controls that ensure confidentiality, integrity and availability of information system assets including hardware, software, firmware and information being processed, stored and communicated
- **CIA Triad**
  - **Confidentiality**: Preserving authorized restrictions on information access / disclosure
    - Data confidentiality
    - Privacy
  - **Integrity**: Guarding against improper information modification or destruction
    - Data Integrity
    - System Integrity
  - **Availability**: Assures the system works properly and services is not denied to authorized users
  - Additional 2 properties
    - **Authenticity**: Verifying that users are who they say they are
      - Each input comes from a trusted source
    - **Accountability**: Ability to trace a security breach to a responsible party
      - System must keep records of activity
- **Levels of Impact on Organization and Individuals**
  - **Low**: Limited Adverse Effect
  - **Medium**: Serious Adverse Effect
  - **High**: Catastrophic Adverse Effect
- **Challenges**
  - Attackers only need to find a single weakness, developer needs to eliminate all weaknesses
  - Requires regular and constant monitoring
  - Often thought of as an impediment to an efficient and user-friendly operation
  - Often security is thought to be incorporated into a system after design is complete
  - Potential attacks on security features must be considered
- **Computer Security Model**
  - **Assets**
    - Hardware
    - Software
    - Data
    - Communication facilities and networks
  - **Vulnerabilities, Threats and Attacks**
    - Categories of vulnerabilities
      - **Corrupted**: Loss of Integrity
      - **Leaky**: Loss of Confidentiality
      - **Unavailable**: Loss of Availability
    - Threats
      - Capable of exploiting vulnerabilities
      - Represent potential security harm to an asset
    - Attacks
      - **Passive**: Attempt to make use of information from system, that doesn't affect system resources
      - **Active**
        - Attempt to alter system resources / affect their operation
      - **Insider**
        - Initiated by an entity inside the security parameter
      - **Outsider**
        - Initiated from outside the security perimeter
- **Countermeasures**
  - Means taken to deal with a security attack
  - Devised to prevent a particular type of attack
    - Or... at-least detect the attack and recover from the effects
