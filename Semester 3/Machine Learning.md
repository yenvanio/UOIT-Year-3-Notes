## Chapter 1 - Introduction to Knowledge-Base Intelligent Systems

### Intelligent Machines
- Intelligence is the ability to **understand** and **learn** things
- Turing's Imitation Game
    - Phase 1
        - Interrogator, Man & Woman
        - Man tries to deceive the interrogator that he is a woman
        - Woman tries to prove to the interrogator that she is a woman
    - Phase 2
        - Man is replaced with a computer
            - Computer provides fuzzy answers to imitate human mistakes
        - If the computer fools the interrogator as much as the man
            - Passed the **Intelligent Behavior** test
    - *A program that is thought to be intelligent in a certain area of expertise, is evaluted by comparing its performance with a human expert.*

### History of Artifcial Intelligence
- Warren McCulloch & Walter Pitts, proposed **Artifical Neural Networks** in 1943
    - Demonstrated that simple network structures could learn
- John von Neumann designed the **Electronic Discrete Variable Calculator**
- Claude Shannon published the paper on chess-playing machines
    - Pointed out that a typical chess game involved about 10<sup>120</sup> possible moves
    - So using the Neumann-type computer it could examine one move per microsecond it would take 3 x 10<sup>106</sup> years to make it's first move.
    - So Shannon proved that you *need heuristics to while searching for the solution*
        - **Heuristic**: Enabling something to learn for itself
- Most funding for AI was stopped because there were no real world applications
    - The problems were always too broad and difficult
    - These were referred to as **Weak Methods**
    - Realized that to deliver practical results, was to solve cases in narrow areas of expertise
- **DENDRAL**
    - Developed at Stanford
        - Purpose was to determine the molecular structure of Martian soil
    - Tried to make computer perform at a human expert level
        - These programs were known as **Expert Systems**
    - Big Paradigm Shift
        - From General Purpose to Domain Specific
