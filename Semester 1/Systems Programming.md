# Systems Programming


## Week 1


#### Linux
- 3 Main Components
  - Kernel
    - Core part of Linux
    - Responsible for all major activities of the OS
    - Has various modules and interacts directly with hardware
    - Kernel provides required abstraction to hide low level hardware details to system or application programs
  - System Library
    - Special functions/programs that can access Kernel's features
    - These libraries implement most of the functionality for the OS and do not need kernel module code access
  - System Utility
    - Programs responsible to do specialized individual level tasks

#### Basic Features of Linux
- Portable
  - Can work on different types of hardware in the same way. Linux Kernel and application programs support installation on any hardware or platform
- Open Source
  - Linux source code is freely available and it is a community based development project
- Multi-User
  - Multiple users can access system resources like mem/ram/programs at the same time
- Multiprogramming
  - Multiple applications can run at the same time
- Hierarchical File System
  - Standard file structure
- Shell
  - Special interpreter program which can be used to execute commands of the OS.
- Security
  - User security using password protection / controlled access to files and data encryption

#### Linux System Architecture (innermost -> outermost)
- Hardware Layer
  - All peripheral devices (RAM/HDD/CPU..etc)
- Kernel
  - Core component of OS, interacts with hardware and provides low-level services to upper layer components
- Shell
  - Interface to kernel, hiding the complexity from users
- Utilities
  - Gives user most of the functionalities of an OS
